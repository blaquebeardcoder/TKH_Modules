Module 2 - Git Bash

========================================

a) What is Git and how is it different than Github?

Git is the most commonly used version control system for developers globally. It is a tool for tracking changes to the folders and files of your code over time. It allows you to view and compare these changes to multiple people on a team in a single place.

Github is kind of like a marketplace for developers to host their git repositories, and it is also a way for developers to attract attention to their portfolios and attract job.  Github is also a collaborative tool for teams to be able to work on their projects and track changes and history of the code they are working on.

b) Why use the terminal?

Why not use the terminal? If you consider yourself a coder, than it is imperative that you learn to speak directly to the computer.  Terminal use is also a more efficient way to access and create files without having to deal with a GUI interface, and to keep your hands on the keyboard. 

c) Explain 3 benefits of version control in your own words?

1. Version control allows you to keep a detailed history of all of the changes made to the repository and code over time.
2. Version control allows multiple people to work on a project without risking or committing to any changes without testing or approvals.
3. Version control allows developers to track their progress and showcase their growth and development as a professional.
